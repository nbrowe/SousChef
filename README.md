# SousChef

An app with a busy home cook in mind. Enables the user to search for cooking ideas through the lens of the current contents of their pantry in an effort to cut down on
wastefulness and unnecessary trips to the supermarket.

Proposed features:
- Pantry tracking. Keep tabs on what you have in your pantry with an always-accessible, editable list on your smart device.
- Recipe search refinement. Uses API calls to search multiple cooking sites from within the app, but smartly filters the results based on your home pantry entries.
- Smart pantry updates. Grabs portion information from recipes that the user has cooked to automatically deduct quantities from the pantry, notifying the user if the app thinks
  certain ingredients are about to run out.
